This blog is an attempt to bring the same disciplines used in programming to Terraform. In the description for Clean Code it states:

>But if code isnâ€™t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.

I believe this also applies to poorly written Terraform configurations. If we can create clean Terraform configurations and modules they will be much easier to maintain, understand, and used by developers.
